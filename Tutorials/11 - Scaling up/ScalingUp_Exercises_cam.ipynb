    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) aka *'the front page of the internet'* is a network of over a million *communities* aka *'subreddits'*, each of which covers a different topic based on people's interests. In other words, it is a *massive* collection of forums (corresponding to the aforementioned communities), where people can share content specific to a given topic or comment on other peopleâ€™s posts.   \n",
    "\n",
    "You are reddit's community manager and want to *appoint new moderators*. Because moderating a specific subreddit isn't a full-time job, you want the chosen moderators to moderate multiple subreddits at the same time. To make this choice effective, the moderators shouldn't have to spend too much time getting to know the community and the prevalent communication style, so it makes sense to let moderators moderate subreddits that are similar in communication style and language. At the same time, it also makes sense to let them moderate subreddits that are similar with respect to the participating users, because this allows moderators to track the behavior of individual users over multiple subreddits. For example, some users might only post offensive content once a month on a given subreddit, and therefore fly under the radar with someone moderating only that subreddit. However, considering all the subreddits these users post to, they might post something offensive every day but on different subreddits. Thus, a moderator in charge of all these subreddits would be able to ban such users much more effectively. In the light of the above description, your task is to find out ways to choose moderators considering both the textual content and the users of a subreddit.\n",
